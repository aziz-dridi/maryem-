You’ve already come so far, and I have no doubt that you’ll achieve everything you set your heart on.
            
            You make the world a better place simply by being in it. Your kindness, your unique way of seeing things, and the warmth you bring to those around you are rare and precious qualities. Never underestimate how much of a difference you make—how much brighter life feels because of you.

You deserve every bit of success, happiness, and love that comes your way, and I’m so grateful to know someone as amazing as you.
